/*Starting with the previous Rodent hierarchy, add a non virtual destructor, create an object of class Hamster using new, 
upcast the pointer to a Rodent*, and delete the pointer to show that it doesnâ€™t call all the destructors in the hierarchy.
Change the destructor to be virtual and demonstrate that the behavior is now correct.*/
